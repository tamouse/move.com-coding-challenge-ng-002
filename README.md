# Coding Project for Move.com: Implement of photo gallery

Although I [implemented][orignal-implementation] this particular exercise originally in [Backbone.JS], 
I decided it would make a nice little exercise to try to learn a bit of [Angular.JS] as well.

## Setting up

I started off by making a very shallow clone of the [angular-seed] repo, blowing away the `.git` 
directory, and re-initializing git to point to my own working repo. The old readme for that seed
is at <README-angular-seed.md>. I then followed the instructions in that old readme.
